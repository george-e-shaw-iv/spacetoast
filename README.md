# The Adventures of Space Toast

This is a really silly game I made in high school to satisfy the requirements
of a programming course. This sat in a `.zip` file on my Google drive for a
long time.

## Playing the Game

You can either clone the repository and open `index.html` or you can play the
game on my GitHub hosted site [here](https://george-e-shaw-iv.github.io/spacetoast/).

## Development Log

The development log, the initial backlog of items to handle while making the
game and my ending thoughts when I put the game on the shelf can all be read
in this [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18tFs7-pxCQT4uEvEK4r8bhC-qDC97KUuarzVGSiJsyU/edit).
